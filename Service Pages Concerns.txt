On the test server this if statement always returns false:
	if ($_SESSION['username'] == $row['username'] && $_SESSION['password'] == $row['password']) {
Also, it seems as if $_SESSION never returns anything not null
This has been tried from multiple accounts.

The admin pages should all work on the real server, the pages were tested on the test server with the above
statement changed to:
	if (true) { 
Let me know if there are any problems

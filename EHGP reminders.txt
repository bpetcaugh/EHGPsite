1) a)make sure Css has centered class for <h1>through<h6>
   b)make sure so that there is no use of align in any of the pages

2)make sure include "IncludeInc_2" is below any call to redirect

3)function makeButton($message, $link) has been added to includeInc_2 for convienence.
	Input is the message to be displayed on the button and the place that the button links too.
	3a) All buttons should be made with the makeButton function
	3b) The index page should use the function, it currently does not
4)Buttons currently use the <a> tag. They should use <a class=button> (or similar) tag.
	4a) the <a> tag should be formatted to be white (or readable color) 
		so that all links are white and readable.
